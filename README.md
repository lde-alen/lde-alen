Hi, I’m Lucas De Alencastro Moreira.

Here you can follow my 42AbuDhabi journey and the projects that I am doing as well as what I put available.

:ghost: I’m currently mostly developping in C and C++ for the next while but will post some other codes or unix projects whenever they occur.
Hope you all have fun and enjoy the ride.

**42 Abu Dhabi Progression and Results:**

**RANK 0:**


Libft: [![lde-alen's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/lde-alen/Libft)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)
> In 42 we are forbidden from using system functions in our projects. This project consists on recreating a series of functions in order to compile them as an archive to create our own Library that will be further enhanced with our own preferences and used for the rest of the cursus.

**RANK 1:**

Ft_printf: [![lde-alen's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/lde-alen/ft_printf)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)
> This project consists on recreating the system printf but not all the flags.

Get_next_line: [![lde-alen's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/lde-alen/get_next_line)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)
> The GNL function takes as parameter a file descriptor and should return the next line available inside the file.

**RANK 2:**

Fract-ol: [![lde-alen's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/lde-alen/fract-ol)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)
> Fract-ol project is mainly a graphical project requiring us to draw a multiple fractals. In Mathematics, a fractal is a subset of Euclidean space with a fractal dimension that strictly exceeds its topological dimension. It contains a pattern that repeats as you zoom and you are supposed to have an infinite zoom, or at least zoom until the limit of your machine.
> For this project we are force to use the minilibx that is a 42 version of the libx which is basically a graphical library in which only a very limited amount of functions are available. Everything else that is required has to be coded by ourselves.
