Hi, I’m Lucas De Alencastro Moreira
Here you can follow my 42AbuDhabi journey and the projects that I am doing as well as what I put available.

:ghost: I’m currently mostly developping in C and C++ for the next while but will post some other codes or unix projects whenever they occur.
Hope you all have fun and enjoy the ride.
